# RS485_application
 - We use temparature/moisture senser and power meter's result and upload to the RS485.
 - And then RS485 connect Arduino D1 with those information.
 - So that D1 can use WIFI function to upload infromation to the cloud(Blynk).
.
## Material
 - temparature and moisture senser
 - power meter
 - RS485
 - RS485-USB converter(check the device ID is correct or not)
 - Arduino D1 board
 - several wires
.
## Getting start
 - Use "Modbus poll" to check temparature/moisture senser and power meter's ID
